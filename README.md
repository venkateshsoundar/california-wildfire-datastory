# How A Booming Population And Climate Change Made California’s Wildfires Worse Than Ever

>An analytical data story exploring the interplay between population growth, human activities, and climate change on California wildfire trends from 1950 to 2017. citeturn6file10

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project examines how a rapidly growing population and evolving climate conditions have exacerbated California wildfires. By integrating wildfire area burned records with demographic and environmental data, we provide a comprehensive narrative of past trends and future risks. citeturn6file10

## 📈 Key Findings

1. **Impact of Climate Change**  
   - Extended dry seasons and higher temperatures correlate with larger and more frequent wildfires.  
2. **Role of Human Activities**  
   - Over 80% of fires are linked to human causes (campfires, power lines, arson).  
3. **Population Growth & Urban Expansion**  
   - Increased settlement in wildland–urban interfaces raises exposure and ignition risk.  
4. **Historical Trends**  
   - Wildfire frequency remained moderate until the 1980s, then rose sharply through 2017.  
5. **Urgent Call to Action**  
   - Enhanced fire management practices, power infrastructure safety, and urban planning are critical for mitigating future risk. citeturn6file10
